Students in my data journalism class used this tool the day after the first Muslim was elected to the Virginia Senate. During their election night coverage, the students, Hannah Eason and Sravan Gannavarapu, noticed a lot of racist and xenophobic comments posted to news stories on Facebook about Ghazala Hashmi's victory in the Senate District 10 race. Hannah and Sravan wanted to analyze the comments to quantify the amount of vitriol online. They found that ExportComments.com can generate a CSV file of Facebook comments (at the time, $5 for three days of unlimited use). Hannah and Sravan downloaded about 3,000 comments posted to five Facebook articles about Hashmi's election and analyzed the data in Excel. The resulting story was distributed the by [AP](http://bit.ly/hashmi-ap) and published by more than 800 news outlets around the world, including [The Washington Post](http://bit.ly/hashmi-wapo). The students also put all [3,000 comments online](http://bit.ly/hashmi-comments) and created [data visualizations](http://bit.ly/hashmi-charts).

Two stories with the same idea: compare costs of grocery store items and cold/flu items at area retail stores. After gathering the data, we created interactive apps that let users compare prices.

I'd like to present the [Accountability Project](https://publicaccountability.org/), a one-stop resource for newsrooms to track money in politics and delineate networks of interests. The project synthesizes public records including campaign finance, lobbying, salaries, properties, etc. and make it easy to download and share the data. I will demo our search portal to present quick searches at the conference and show local newsrooms can use the feature both for quick-turn stories and in-depth watchdog reporting. It is a very quick way for newsrooms to find their local politicians' interests and connections from out-of-state without having to navigate data silos that are foreign to them.

Crashes, taxes, cyber-crime and ....bearded dragons? This presentation will show a series of quick hit data dives with interactive graphics, ranging from the serious to the amusing, that spotlight narrow pieces of data and allow someone in a small newsroom to have a regular data presence outside of long-term projects. This is the opposite of what is shown in a lot of the panels, giving examples of what can be done with weekly data presentations instead of a big project...something manageable and valuable in a small operation.

While covering the Montana statehouse in 2019, I sat down and adapted OpenStates code to produce a [news app tabulating lawmaker voting records](https://apps.montanafreepress.org/track-mtleg-2019/).

The process produced a tip that let me investigate how a right-wing website was [tracking votes in an effort to influence GOP lawmakers](https://montanafreepress.org/2019/04/01/this-website-ranks-republican-lawmakers-on-party-loyalty-is-that-good-for-montana/) and also set the stage for a story where I explained how a Republican-controlled legislature passed several [high-profile bills opposed by the official GOP leadership](https://montanafreepress.org/2019/05/03/when-solutions-caucus-republicans-in-the-2019-legislature-did-and-didnt-vote-with-democrats/).

The federal government posts all U.S. nursing home inspection results online in a searchable database. For state-regulated homes, Vermont's Division of Licensing and Protection posts only poorly scanned, sometimes partially handwritten pdfs in a hard-to-find spot that require additional information to decode (example [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKzoGEWWsAAkVip?format=png&name=small)). I scraped those inspections, but when we asked for a full list it turned out that nearly 20 percent of the reports generated between 2014 and late 2019 had never been uploaded. Once we had all those documents, they formed the foundation for an investigative collaboration between Seven Days and Vermont Public Radio and a searchable database of Vermont homes, which I built:

This is a direct inspiration from WRAL report, showcased at NICAR2019. By intense calculation of drive time to voting station, we showed that [costly makeshift early-voting stations did not improve overall turnout](https://www.chunichi.co.jp/ee/feature/data/early_voting_stations_en.html), implying they just replace Sunday vote.

We published a [series of stories](
https://www.syracuse.com/news/2020/01/see-which-syracuse-streets-won-lost-in-citys-quest-for-fairer-tax-assessments-map.html) that showed Syracuse's system of assessing home values is benefiting the rich and overtaxing the poor. The city responded quickly by changing more home values than ever in its annual adjustment. The latest story maps those increases and decreases so people can compare neighborhoods and take their own arguments to City Hall. Grievance hearings are happening now. 

To do this project, we used simple google mapping tools and we used excel to analyze the city's assessment rolls. We also used Caspio to create a searchable database.

Here are some other stories about the issue:

Using Census and tax roll data, as well as statistics from Princeton's Eviction Lab, I wrote a series of articles that looked into why Reading Pa., where real estate is inexpensive, has such a high rate of rentals and, in particular, evictions. The series, called "City of Renting," can be found by clicking on the link below.
